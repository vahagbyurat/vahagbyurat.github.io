        <h3 id="Smbat">Smbat Byurat </h3>
        <p><b>Smbat Byurat&#x27;s biography is written by his son Hayk-Levon Byurat</b></p>
        <p>Smbat Byurat was born on March 3rd, 1862 in Zeytun, at Shovoryan (or Baz Bayir) quarter. He received his
            elementary education in Zeytun. 9 years old, he left Zeytun and attended and graduated from Jharankavorats
            School (Armenian Theological Seminary) in Jerusalem, then continued his education in Sorbonne, France. </p>

        <div class="image-container"><img src='images/image24.jpeg'></div>
        <p>In 1880 he returned to Cilicia, started helping the education system, first as a helper of the principal,
            later
            as a principal of Cilicia&#x27;s Marash Central School district. 1880 Byurat organized “Kilikio pahapan”
            (The
            protector of Cilicia) organization, where he was able to connect with all religious centers of Cilicia and
            get
            the first census done in Cilicia. He was teaching in Zeytun from 1882 to 1884. In 1885 he opened a private
            school and taught in Sis for only 6 months, but could not continue due to climate and that summer he went to
            Constantinople and met times&#x27; biggest and greatest writers there. In “Erkragund &#x27;&#x27; (The
            Globe), he
            published his first writing “Meryalner” (The Dead) in the August 1885 issue.</p>
        <p>In 1885 he published his first book, which was about the geography and history of the Zeytun region. In 1885
            he
            also met and married to Xas-gyux Orphanage school teacher, Yevdoxia Shishmanyan. </p>

        <div class="image-container2"><img src='images/image18.jpeg'></div>
        <p>In 1886 he returned to Zeytun with his wife as a Union School inspector. On August 10, 1886, Yevdoxia gave
            birth
            to his first son Vaghinak. Smbat spent much time travelling to establish schools all around the region. In
            1887
            from the Zeytun great fire where 950 houses burned, Smbat lost his family house and with his wife left for
            Constantinople. Less than 6 months later, he gets an assignment at Samson and spends 3 years there. In 1890
            with
            his pregnant wife and child, he was on his way to Zeytun, when he was arrested at Yerpuz village and they
            were
            taken to Marash prison, where Smbat&#x27;s second son: Hayk-Levon was born September 1890.</p>
        <p>Smbat and 48 other political prisoners were kept in prison until the end of 1895 in Aleppo. After he was
            freed,
            he relocated to Constantinople (Istanbul).</p>

        <p>In 1896, he realized that Sultan&#x27;s police were after him again, forcing him and his family to flee to
            Egypt.
            He
            published his first newspaper “Nor Or &#x27;&#x27; (New Day) and Puniq (Phoenix) in Egypt. Smbat opened
            private
            schools for four years in Cairo and Alexandria. Tired of the political party&#x27;s constant arguments, he
            completely
            stopped being a political figure in 1900. Same year he signed agreements with &quot;Hratarakchakan&quot;
            (Publication) of Tbilisi to send them his unpublished works for mass publication, but soon he learned that
            &quot;Hratarakchakan&quot; was bankrupt. With help, he again started publication of Puniq (Phoenix) at Cairo
            for
            another four years.</p>

            Court systems Officer. During these years he was traveling to Venice Italy and other cities with his sons.
            His
            sons were applying to go school in St. Lazare, Venice, Italy. In 1907 he went to Romania for 10 months, but
            having fallen victim to political games, he had to leave the country quickly. He moved to Bulgaria to teach,
            where he was caught by spies and arrested again by the Sultan&#x27;s police. On the way to Constantinople,
            news
            arrives that the Young Turks overthrow the Sultan, and Smbat was able to escape. Smbat with his family
            returns
            to Constantinople (Istanbul). In 1908 he was elected as a National Representative for 10 years to represent
            Zeytun-Marash region. End of that year, with his older son -Vaghinak he opened a Publishing House. </p>

        <p>In 1910 with his younger son Hayk-Levon he came back home to Zeytun to visit his parents&#x27; graves. For
            three
            and
            half months they visited almost all of Cilicia&#x27;s major locations. On their way back, they visited
            Athens,
            Greece.</p>
        <p>From 1908 to 1914 he wrote and published over 40 books while fighting political wars to free Armenia. Then
            came
            World War I, where the Turks decided to address “The Armenian Question,” by exiling and killing over two
            million
            Armenians from Turkish-Armenia. Smbat Byurat, along with most of the Armenian political and cultural
            leaders,
            was arrested and exiled in April of 1915 to Ayaş, Ottoman Turkey. All were massacred; according to rumors,
            he
            was stoned to death. His last words sent to his sons were: “I am a dead man now. Forget about my body. Save
            my
            writings...”.</p>

        <p>He married first time 1911 in Istanbul Turkey. His first wife&#x27;s name was Araxi and their god father was
            Grigor
            Zohrap.</p>


        <p>He had 2 daughters from that marriage-Anais and Sirarpie, both stayed in Istanbul as much as we know under
            their
            uncle&#x27;s care till they got married.</p>
        <p>1912 Vaghinak was on “Titanic” and survived when he was taking 6000 books to America.</p>
        <p>In 1925 Vaghinak left Turkey and lived in Lebanon and in and out in Syria. A little before then Hayk-Levon
            with his mother had moved to Cairo, Egypt.</p>
        <p>Vaghinak remarried in 1933, and his only son was born in 1934, named Smbat in his grandfather&#x27;s memory.
        </p>


        <p>Vaghinak Byurat in 1946 with his family repatriated to Soviet Armenia. They took with them over 6,000 books
            to
            Armenia. Most of the books were confiscated from them as forbidden anti-governmental and nationalistic
            literature. </p>
        <p>The only literary work Vaghinak was able to do in Soviet Armenia was in commemoration of the 50th anniversary
            of
            Armenian Genocide, he published Smbat Byurat&#x27;s short biography in a magazine.</p>
        <p>Vaghinak Byurat lived a long life to his old years. During Christmas of 1965 Vaghinak fell on the street and
            broke his hip. For 80 years old Vaghinak it was very hard to become bed bound. </p>

        </div>
        <p>Now he uses his time educating and teaching his 5 years old grandson. He taught Haik to play card games and
            backgammon. But education took first priority, teaching him mathematics and Armenian language. Later years
            he
            taught him Armenian Literature, making a multi-page list of the books for Haik to read. He taught Haik to
            Love
            the Armenian Language unconditionally. Haik was taking care of his grandpa, loved and appreciated him a lot.
            Haik especially loved to hear his grandpa&#x27;s life stories, Armenian and foreign tales. One of the ways
            Vaghinak
            described someone&#x27;s death is that he did “poof” and passed. That is exactly how he passed January 6,
            1972,
            without suffering and like a candle burning all the way to the end.</p>
        <p>His major dream was to see his father&#x27;s works published in Armenia, but he did not succeed. He died with
            hope
            in
            his heart. It is fair to state that his own people forgot Smbat Byurat&#x27;s literary contributions and
            heroic
            fall.
            Artists would sing one of Smbat Byurat&#x27;s famous songs “Adana Lamentation” (Adanayi Oxb@), yet it was
            recognized
            as a folk song by an unknown writer. His heirs did not fight the Soviet bureaucracy, and in 1980 they
            immigrated
            to the United States with empty packets…</p>

        <h3 id="Hayk-Levon">Hayk-Levon Byurat</h3>

        <p>Younger son of Smbat Byurat was born in Marash prison, September 1890: Here is how Smbat Byurat describing
            his
            birth in the Marash prison:</p>
        <p>Young Woman was screaming from the pain with one voice, screaming for a couple of seconds, paused to cry, and
            then she was screaming again, more pitiful and more powerful.</p>
        <p>-Let&#x27;s clean the room, please leave the room, all of you, -asked doctor Polatyan.</p>
        <p>Fatma Tutu escorted all of them out-both Armenians and both Turks. She returned to the cell, proud of her
            job&#x27;s
            power and duty. </p>
        <p>The child, forgotten by everyone (Smbat&#x27;s first son), was sleeping in the corner of the cell, while her
            mother
            was still suffering.</p>
        <p>A scream came out of the giving birth mother, which was signaling the critical second. Mother&#x27;s scream
            was
            followed by the baby&#x27;s scream.</p>
        <p>That scream was from a newborn Armenian boy, who was announcing his victorious entrance to the tyranny of the
            world. That was the cry of the future soldier, who was opening his eyes inside the Crime and Pain room. They
            wrapped the baby in the leftover clothes of the prisoners, and the dirt was his bed. Fatma Tutu was in joy
            and
            holiday, because she had a new prisoner under her care-a newborn baby prisoner. The mother sadly looked at
            her
            newborn. She took her newborn and with maternal instinct gave him a breast to suck milk from. And he
            carelessly
            sucked the milk, the milk that comes from the Suffering and Pain fountain. Looked the mother to her newborn
            proud and happy, and she hugged him, giving him her first motherly kisses on his chicks. She was whispering
            an
            old sweet lullaby. More she looked, the happier she became. She was so happy that she brought life to the
            place
            where lives get lost every day. </p>
        <p>These feelings were comforting her, making her forget reality, the four cold and dark walls reality. She was
            thinking that the newborn baby would be the reason for her to get her freedom, since it was unimaginable to
            live
            in these conditions. She had big hopes for her soon to come freedom. With that hope in her mind, she slept
            the
            baby on her chest and the other child on her side.</p>

            <p>Hayk-Levon Byurat (1890-1953)</p>
        </div>
        <p>Forty days later:</p>
        <p>In Marash&#x27;s St. Stepannos church, which was sitting right under the Marash&#x27;s Castle, there was a
            christening
            in
            process, with a large crowd present. They were baptizing the prison born baby boy. At the baby&#x27;s
            christening
            present were father, his uncle Avetiq and Der-Ghazar high priest grandfather, who despite his eighty plus
            years,
            rushed to Marash after getting his son&#x27;s letter. Although the baby&#x27;s mother asked to name the baby
            Tsavak
            (Painful) because he was born in jail, his father wanted to name him Hayk-Levon: Hayk for the Armenian
            Nation&#x27;s
            first ancestor and freedom fighter, and Levon for the last Armenian King, imprisoned in chains… The newborn
            was
            named Hayk-Levon.</p>
        <p> Family suffered hard 5 years of Smbat Byurat prisoning first in Marash, later at Aleppo. After relise of
            prison
            family goes to Constantinople and Smbat becomes teacher in Armenian school, but knowing that sultan&#x27;s
            spies
            are
            after him, he finds a way to escape from there to Egypt 1896.</p>
        <p>Hayk got most of his knowledge at home, first from his parents, later from his brother. With family he lives
            in
            Alexandria from 1896-1908, then moves to Constantinople with his family. He worked with his brother and
            learn
            book publishing business. Hayk-Levon lives with his mother Yevdoxia after Armenian genocide. He got married
            but
            we do not have name of the wife. It was very unhappy marriage per Vaghinak. 1925 he moves with mother and
            wife
            to Egypt, lives in Cairo and Alexandria till 1948. During that time he gets authorization from Vaghinak to
            use
            “Jamanakakic Matenashar” (Modern Lithography) name and published 65 different books, most of them Smbat
            Byurat&#x27;s
            republications. He had low key life, still was prosecuted by locals. 1948 he repatriated to Soviet Armenia,
            carrying with him 7,000 books. The ship after dropping 1,500 Armenian repatriates in Batumi, on its way to
            Russia had fire in board and many lives were lost. </p>

        <p>With Stalin&#x27;s order some of the Armenians were charged as English-American spies and Hayk-Levon was
            exiled to
            Siberia. He was skin and bones and authorities decided to send him home 1953 to die there and that is what
            exactly happen to him. Within days of his return he saw his brother Vaghinak and passed away within week.
            Vaghinak blame his brother&#x27;s wife for his death and never seen her after that. We know that Hayk-Levon
            had
            daughter, but we do not know anything about her. </p>
        <p>This is the story what we were able to find up to now. We are very sad for my grandfather&#x27;s
            brother&#x27;s life. I
            named after him and still digging the history to find more information about him.</p>

        <h3 id="BCF">The Byurat Cultural Foundation (BCF) and Vahag Byurat Concepts Inc.</h3>

        <p>The Byurat Cultural Foundation (BCF) was officially established in January 2000 by Haik and Hasmik Byurat in
            the
            United States. The foundation&#x27;s purpose is to introduce and translate the literary works of Smbat and
            Vaghinak Byurat to the Armenian community throughout the world, and especially in the United States. Some of
            the
            published works will be translated to English if there is interest. </p>
        <p>The foundation published 4 books from 1999-2002 in Armenia.</p>
        <p> The first book published in 1999 is the short self-biography of Vaghinak Byurat titled “My Life&#x27;s
            Memories,”
            or
            in Armenian, “Im Kyanki Hoosherits&#x27; &#x27;. In 2002, we also published Vaghinak&#x27;s “Best
            Writings&#x27;&#x27; or in Armenian, “Endir Edjer” which includes &quot;Aryunot Tashkinak&quot; (translated:
            &quot;Bloody Handkerchief&quot;) and “Shekhi Vortin” (translated: “Sheik&#x27;s Son”).</p>
        <p>In 2001, we were able to publish one of Smbat Byurat&#x27;s books for the first time in Armenia. It was his
            first
            book entitled, “Best of Novels&#x27;&#x27; or in Armenian, “Yerger.”</p>
        <p>Also, in 2002, the foundation published a book named, “Smbat Byurat&#x27;s World of Novels” in Armenian,
            translated:
            “Smbat Byurati Vebashkhare.” The book was published by the State Museum of Literature and Art of Armenia.
        </p>
        <p>With the publication of these two Smbat Byurat&#x27;s books for the very first time in Armenia, we made
            Vaghinak
            Byurat&#x27;s dream a reality.</p>
        <p>Byurat Cultural Foundation and Vahag Byurat Concepts Inc., financed and publishing 5-th book in Armenia. That
            was
            Smbat Byurat&#x27;s “Poems”. Published March of 2022, for Smbat Byurat&#x27;s 160-th birthday.</p>
        <p>In July 4, 2023, Byurat Cultural Foundation and Vahag Byurat Concepts Inc., financed and publishing 6-th
            book in
            Armenia. This was Smbat Byurat&#x27;s autobiography called “Diary of Mountain Man”, which used 367
            handwritten
            pages
            from his archived work, from Yeghishe Charents State Museum of Art and Literature of Armenia.</p>

        <p>2021, Haik and Hasmik Byurat translated first ever English book for Smbat Byurat. By translating Smbat
            Byurat&#x27;s
            first ever book to English, we are trying to achieve the following:</p>
        <p>We want our new Armenian generations to learn and cherish our over 3500 years old language, but in case they
            do
            forget (in my opinion unbelievable sin against being Armenian), still we want our new generations to come to
            know their roots.</p>
        <p> We want the whole world to know what happened before all Armenian massagers of 19-th century and Genocide of
            1915 in Turkey.</p>
        <p>Although we lost Byurat Cultural Foundations being a charitable organization 2005 due to NO support from the
            community, we will still continue to operate our organization to teach and preserve the Armenian language.

        <p>From 1908 to 1914 he wrote and published over 40 books</p>
        <p>Vaghinak and Hayk-Levon published all his works from 1908-1937 in Turkey, Lebanon, Syria and Egypt.</p>
        <p>Almost impossible to find these books in good condition, since 1980 Byurat family was able to collect ONLY 8
            original published books by Byurats and 1 published by some other.</p>
        <p>So, we were hopelessly waiting for another book to show up that we can buy and keep and we were thinking that
            Smbat Byurat&#x27;s most of the books we will not be able to save.</p>
        <p>Then we investigated and beginning year 2020 we found most of the books in Armenia&#x27;s main library. Most
            of
            these
            books were the ones that was confiscated from our family 1946-1948, proof of it is Vaghinak Byurat&#x27;s
            hand
            writings on them. That year we meet with Tigran Zargaryan who was instrumental next years to put most of
            these
            books digital and make it available on line. Only book we did not find is “Bible” written in Zeytun dialect.

        <p>Story of the “Adana Song/ Adana Lamentation”</p>
        <p>July 1908, The Young Turk Revolution was a constitutionalist revolution in the Ottoman Empire. The Committee
            of
            Union and Progress, an organization of the Young Turks movement, forced Sultan Abdul Hamid II to restore the
            Ottoman Constitution and recall the parliament.</p>
        <p>Lots of exiled intellectuals cheered this Revolution and return to homeland, including Smbat Byurat, who
            returned
            to Constantinople from Egypt.</p>
        <p>Ottoman and Armenian revolutionary groups had cooperated to secure the deposition of Sultan Abdul Hamid II
            and
            the restoration of constitutional rule in 1908. In reaction, on 31 March 1909 (13 April by the Western
            Gregorian
            calendar) a military revolt directed against the CUP seized Constantinople (Istanbul after 1928). While the
            revolt lasted only ten days, it precipitated a pogrom and massacres in Adana Province against Armenians that
            lasted over a month.</p>
        <p>Smbat Byurat wrote his poem “Adana Lamentation- (Adanayi Voghp) in the memory of the victims 1909 and
            publishes
            it first time in one of his magazines, if I am not mistaken in “Gaxapar” (Opinion) June of 1909.</p>
        <p>In 1911, the poem was published in the book &lt;&lt;Հայուն երգարանը&gt;&gt; (Armenians Song Book) by Hmayak
            Aramyants on page 287 (please see attached picture).</p>
        <p>In 1912 the poem again was published in &lt;&lt;Կիլիկիոյ Աղետը&gt;&gt; (Disaster of Cilicia) by Hakop
            Terzeyan on
            page 851(see attached picture).</p>
        <p>Unfortunately, after 1940&#x27;s when this poem was published again and again…, NO ONE in Armenian Diaspora
            wrote
            the
            writers name (please see attached picture), and in Armenia Smbat Byurat was forbitten literature. Because of
            this, people called the poem and the song a folk song, Author&#x27;s name never being mentioned.</p>
        <p>In Armenia, singers started singing this song late 1970-s, but this song was sung in Armenian diaspora almost
            immediately after the poem was written (the fact is that it was published in the song book very first time
            in
            1911). Even being a sad song, Armenians still sang this in their gatherings, even in their weddings. </p>
        <p>First time I ever heard this song was by my aunt Araxi when I was 3 years old, in 1963. When I was 10 years
            old,
            my grandpa Vaghinak recited this poem to me couple of times, with deep sadness about his forgotten father.
            He
            showed me in the Book &lt;&lt;Զեյթունի պատմությունը&gt;&gt; (History of Zeytun) by H. Pogosyan, where only
            two
            of the verses of the poem were on page 371.</p>
        <p>In America, after looking for a long time, I was able to find this poem in entirety in 1998, and I bought
            Armenian Alphabet fonts for my computers and typed it for myself. I published it 1999-2000 in my
            announcement
            articles to Armenian community about the establishment of the Byurat Cultural Foundation. First 5 years, BCF
            was
            charitable organization, but we lost that because of no financial support of the community. Nevertheless, we
            used those 5 years publishing 4 books in Armenia, putting the cornerstone of the Smbat Byurat&#x27;s name,
            bringing
            back from forgotten and forbitten status.</p>
        <p>March of this year, we published Smbat Byurat&#x27;s “Poems” book and the “Adana Song/ Adana Lamentation”
            poem was
            first time ever published along with ALL the rest of the poems that Smbat Byurat wrote. For the poem&#x27;s
            page,
            lovely Sibil offered us a URL that if you scan with your cell phone, it will take you to the website, where
            Sibil is performing the song.</p>
        <p>April 27, 2022, I watched for the first time an entire 30 minutes of television program created by Hasmik
            Hakhverdyan with Գրականության և արվեստի թանգարան /Museum of Literature and Art/ of Armenia. In this program
            they
            first presented short history of Smbat Byurat&#x27;s life, this poem, and Armenian famous singers presenting
            stories
            about the poem and the song. This was very beautiful and tastefully created program. I thank Hasmik
            Hakhverdyan,
            all the singers-Acabi Gazarian, Flora Martirosyan, Zaruhi Babayan, Nune Yesayan, Sibil Pektorosoglu, Maria
            Cozette and the entire team for this wonderful program!</p>

            The massacre is ruthless, let the Armenians cry,
            <br>
            The glorious Adana turned to a desert.
            <br>
            Fire and sword and ruthless plunder
            <br>
            Oh…, they ransacked the house of the Rubenians.
            <br>
            Not a minute passed and the poor Armenians,
            <br>
            They fell under the sword in terror of the mob,
            <br>
            Churches and school were lost in the flames,
            <br>
            Many Armenians died carelessly.
            <br>
            Alas, rich Adana was idle!
            <br>
            The whole of Cilicia was reduced to ashes,
            <br>
            Only beautiful Hadjin Survived,
            <br>
            Why did not Zeytun move from his cliff?
            <br>
            From the fire day and night,
            <br>
            Enemy sword, bullet from outside,
            <br>
            The Armenians were wiped off the face of the earth,
            <br>
            Blood running from our Clear rivers.

        <div class="image-container"><img src='images/image3.png'></div>

        <br>
        <p>My dad is one of the smartest individuals that I have met in my technical life. Physical work never
            interested him; however, he was a real scientist all of his life.</p>
        <p>In 1957 Smbat graduated from Yerevan Polytechnic Institute. Twenty years later I followed in his footsteps by
            excelling in the entrance exams, and chose the same specialty in Electro-Chemistry at his alma mater. </p>
        <p>After immigrating to the U.S.A., he never got his dream job. It was a 9-year-venture that he eventually gave
            up without a single complaint.</p>
        <p>He will be 89-years-old within weeks, and I want to dedicate this post to the work he has accomplished in his
            lifetime. Most of his achievements had been credited to his employers in order to be granted permission to
            publish. </p>
        <p>My dad was compensated ~$90 for the 2 technical inventions that he worked on, when the USSR sold them to
            American companies&#x27; for hundreds of millions of dollars in the 1960&#x27;s. The engine was used at that
            time to
            create artificial diamonds by using a crystallization process.</p>
        <p>I spent lots of time to scan and prep all of these materials so that you can <a
